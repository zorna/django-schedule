TODO list for ajax_ui branch - weekcalendar:

 * cleanup in weekcal.js - lots of copy-and-paste programming there, and handling of dates is awful
 * mouseover preview of an event (?)
 * make variable naming in weekcal.js consistent (event vs occurrence)

A big question mark:

 * support for multi-day events (???)
